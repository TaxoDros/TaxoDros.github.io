# TaxoDros PDFs

Due to copyright restrictions, the PDF files associated with the TaxoDros literature references are *not* included in this repository. However, the sha256/md5 signatures of the pdf files are included. This allows to verify the authenticity of an obtained pdf associated with a specific signature.

To help organize the many references that TaxoDros keeps, pdf files signatures are grouped in folders by the first letter of the first author.

For instance, the signatures of the reference `DaLage et al., 1989a.pdf` can be found in [D/DaLage et al., 1989a.pdf.md5](D/DaLage%20et%20al.,%201989a.pdf.md5) for the associated md5 signature, and [D/DaLage et al., 1989a.pdf.sha256](D/DaLage%20et%20al.,%201989a.pdf.sha256) for the associated sha256 signature. 

[calc-hashes.sh](calc-hashes.sh) is the script used to generate these signature files from their original pdfs. Note that file signatures are also called "hashes."
